            <li>Baking forms that we do are the high-end, one of a kind forms that will usually not be reused. For this reason,
                we use a thin-walled, pre-treated form that will minimize sticking of both frozen and hot desserts. With
                the possibility of using silicon for smaller ones.

                Mike Garand started a business that has grown into FarLynx making pan forms back in high school. He has gone on to create
                many custom forms, including a large multi-piece one used to replicate Bart Simpson for the anniversary dinner.
                His work in the past has been used as a basis for ice sculpting, the The San Francisco Ice Cream Festival,
                and custom small pies for the 150th birthday dinner at the Abe Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation. His
                first pan was one invented to assist in making a chess cake.
